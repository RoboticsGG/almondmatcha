# X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1

The X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 serves as a supplementary board for motion MEMS and environmental sensors intended for the STM32 Nucleo. The X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 connects to the STM32 microcontroller or Arduino boards via the I²C pin, and revolves around various sensors such as the 

- **[LSM6DSV16X 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope](https://github.com/Perlatecnica/PLT_LSM6DSV16X)**
- **[LSM6DSO16IS 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope equipped with ISPU]**
- **[LIS2DUXS12 3D accelerometer]**
- **[LIS2MDL 3D magnetometer]**
- **[SHT40-AD1B humidity and temperature sensor]**
- **[LPS22DF pressure and temperature sensor](https://github.com/Perlatecnica/xNucleo-IKS4A1_LPS22DF_mbedOS_000-GetTempPress)**
- **[STTS22H temperature sensor](https://github.com/Perlatecnica/xNucleo-IKS4A1_STTS22H_mbedOS_000-GetTemperature)**
